`window_proc()` is responsible for handling messages sent to the window, such as user interactions (closing the window, resizing, etc.).
#### **Breakdown of the function**

```cpp
LRESULT windowApp::window_proc(HWND window, UINT message, WPARAM wparam, LPARAM lparam) {
    switch (message) {
        case WM_CLOSE:
            DestroyWindow(window);
            return 0;

        case WM_DESTROY:
            if (window == m_main)
                PostQuitMessage(EXIT_SUCCESS);
            return 0;
    }
    return DefWindowProcW(window, message, wparam, lparam);
}
```

#### **How it works:**

1. **Windows sends messages** to your application, and `window_proc()` handles them.
2. **WM_CLOSE:**
    - Triggered when the user tries to close the window (e.g., clicking the "X" button).
    - The function `DestroyWindow(window)` is called to close it.
3. **WM_DESTROY:**
    - Triggered when the window is actually being destroyed.
    - If the destroyed window is the **main window**, `PostQuitMessage(EXIT_SUCCESS)` is called to exit the application.
4. **Default case (`DefWindowProcW`)**:
    - If the message is not explicitly handled, it's forwarded to the default window procedure (`DefWindowProcW`), which ensures that other system messages (like keyboard and mouse events) are properly processed.
